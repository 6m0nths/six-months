        <h3>So I was going through my photos one day as I do, and I figured it would be cool to tell about all the ways my pictures of you have made me feel better when I'm sad or upset. Like you have no idea just how helpful it is to get to see you and I have a lot of stories about how they've helped me before. So get ready to hear a ton about how perfect you are and how happy you make me. I made this website live today, and all this stuff still stands. I know things have been rough but that doesn't change how I feel about you at all. So without furtuer ado...</h3>

        <h3>This picture is so perfect because it reminds me of how fun you are. You're super cute when you talk about things you like, and in this case it happened to be boats.</h3>

        <h3>I love looking back at these because it reminds me of how much you want to make me happy. You do fun things like eating cereal all the time so I can see it and it makes me borderline giddy every time you do it :)</h3>
        <h3>Also just look at how cute your arms are. Like seriously I just want to squeeze them and then drag you into a super big hug and never let go even if you end up peeing on me.</h3>

        <img src="img/candy.png">
        <h3>Okay like how am I even supposed to not get tinglies looking at this? You're so cute and you're happy and eating fun candy. It reminds me of all the times we've eaten unhealthy food together and how fun those were (CVS had better look out for us after prom).</h3>

        <h3>These pictures make me want to go find you and give you a super big hug and it would be one of those hugs where we're both kinda moving around and sometimes we lose our balance and I'm moving my arms around a bit and taking in how nice you feel. You in these pictures is the trifecta of giving me tinglies. You've got the fluffy Patagonia, fun wavy hair, and a flannel shirt. It's like you're trying to give me a heart attack.</h3>

        <h3>Most of my pictures are of you being fun, and these don't disappoint. You're being super cute and letting me see you eat and I love it so much and just want to go party with you whenever I look at these. I really enjoy getting to hang out with you and stuff myself and just relax, and these pictures remind me of how we're able to be so comfortable around each other.</h3>

        <h3>These pictures are kind of bittersweet for me because I love seeing you but you were sick when you sent me these and I couldn't see you thsoe days. I still keep them around because 1) you're super pretty and 2) it makes me hopeful about us when I think about just how much I miss you even after just one day. If I could I would always be with you no matter what. That's the real goal right there.</h3>

        <h3>When I see these pictures I get a sudden urge to give you soft kisses. The cookie dough one reminds me of how we'll sometimes kiss with food in our mouths and it makes me smile to think about how we can be weird around each other. And yeah the tongue one just makes me want to give you kisses until you feel better because I'm a super good manservant.</h3>
